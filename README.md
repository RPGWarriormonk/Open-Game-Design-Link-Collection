# open-game-design-link-collection
A collection of links to ressources, posts and game texts for Open Game Design.

Recently, people on [Story-Games](https://story-games.com) have expressed interest in a game design scene which both values design work while encouraging GMs and other designers to hack, adapt, remix and otherwise fold, spindle and mutilate the game text in their own design. In the course of the discussion, people have also expressed interest in using tools like git or open licenses to make this remix and collaborative work easier.

This repository is intended to be a place to collect links to ressources around this idea.

## How to participate:

To participate in the general discourse around open game design, you can join the discussion or start your own (On Story Games or elsewhere), design games and publish them for other to reuse or take what somebody else has published and incorporate it in your own work, remix it and so on.

To collaborate on this text, feel free to send a pull request with changes or additions here on github or poke me someplace else. (Like on [Story Games](http://story-games.com/forums/profile/Lord_Minx) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lordminx).) I'll gladly add links for people who can't or won't use git.
